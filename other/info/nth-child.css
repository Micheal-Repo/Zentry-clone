To select the first, second, or third child of an element in CSS, you can use the :nth-child() pseudo-class. Hereâ€™s how:

Syntax:

/* Select the first child */
.element:nth-child(1) {
  /* Styles for the first child */
}

/* Select the second child */
.element:nth-child(2) {
  /* Styles for the second child */
}

/* Select the third child */
.element:nth-child(3) {
  /* Styles for the third child */
}

Example:

/* Example for a container with child divs */
.container div:nth-child(1) {
  background-color: red; /* First child */
}

.container div:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: green; /* Second child */
}

.container div:nth-child(3) {
  background-color: blue; /* Third child */
}

Notes:

1. :nth-child() is a 1-based index, meaning the first child is 1, not 0.


2. It selects the element based on its position among its siblings of the same parent.


3. If you only want to target children of a specific type (e.g., div), make sure to include the tag name in the selector (e.g., .container div:nth-child(1)).



Additional Selectors:

:first-child is equivalent to :nth-child(1).

:nth-last-child(n) selects elements counting from the end.

:nth-of-type(n) selects elements of a specific type (e.g., div) in the nth position.
